# Entanglement cooling algorithm

The **Entanglement cooling algorithm** computes the statistical properties of the entanglement spectrum by applying a Metropolis-like entanglement cooling algorithm generated by different sets of local gates, on states sharing the same statistic. The initial states are the ground states of the one-dimensional quantum Ising model in its different macroscopic phases (paramagnetic, the magnetically ordered and the topologically frustrated).

The code is developed at the [Rudjer Bošković Institute](https://www.irb.hr/) by the Condensed Matter and Statistical Physics Group and the [Centre for Informatics and Computing](https://cir.com.hr/)

The code is written in Python which enables straightforward portability over different computational platforms. The code supports execution on shared memory systems (manycore and multi-CPU systems) and on distributed GPUs systems using the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
